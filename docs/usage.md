# Documentation for Using `FeatureFlagClient.getFlags` Function

The `FeatureFlagClient.getFlags` function is used to retrieve the value of a feature flag for a specific user session. This function plays a crucial role in controlling the visibility and availability of features for different users, based on predefined flag values.

### Function Parameters

The `FeatureFlagClient.getFlags` function accepts three parameters:

1. `featureFlag`: This parameter represents the name of the feature flag for which the value needs to be retrieved. In our context, the `featureFlag` is set to `"enable_integration"`.

2. `FeatureFlagClient.createCtx(userSession)`: This parameter is a call to the `createCtx` function of the `FeatureFlagClient`, with `userSession` as its argument. This function generates the context required to check the feature flag's state for the specific user. The `userSession` argument carries all necessary user-specific information.

3. `true`: This parameter, when set to `true`, instructs the function to return a default value (which is usually `false`), in case the function call fails for any reason. This is a safeguard to prevent potential crashes or unexpected behavior due to failure in retrieving the flag value.

### Function Usage

Below is the code snippet demonstrating the usage of the `FeatureFlagClient.getFlags` function:

```javascript
const featureFlag = "enable_integration";

const flagValue = await FeatureFlagClient.getFlags(
  featureFlag,
  FeatureFlagClient.createCtx(userSession), // Pass the user session to the feature flag management system to check user-specific flag state.
  true
);
```

In this code:

1. We first define the `featureFlag` as `"enable_integration"`.

2. Then, we call `FeatureFlagClient.getFlags` function and store its return value in the `flagValue` variable.

3. If the user-specific feature flag state is `true`, it signifies that the `enable_integration` feature is turned on for the user represented by the `userSession`. Conversely, if it's `false`, the feature is turned off for the user.

Remember, this function call is asynchronous (returns a Promise), so you must use `await` when calling this function to make sure that the function completes its execution before the value is assigned to `flagValue`. `await` can only be used inside an `async` function.

This `flagValue` can then be used in your code to control whether a specific feature (in this case, "enable_integration") should be enabled or not for the current user session.

# Decoupling Decision Points from Decision Rules

When building robust systems, it's crucial to maintain a clean and manageable codebase. One common way to achieve this is by decoupling decision points from decision rules, especially when working with feature flags.

### Understanding the Need

While multiple code paths are inevitable when you need the ability to switch between them at runtime, it doesn't necessarily imply that every decision point should be dealing with these decisions in terms of feature flags. For long-lived feature flags, a more effective approach is to distinguish the specific question your code is asking from the feature flag driving that decision.

### Practical Example

Consider the following code example that utilizes a feature flag:

```javascript
export async function enable_integration(userSession) {
  return FeatureFlagClient.getFlags(
    "enable_integration",
    FeatureFlagClient.createCtx(userSession),
    true
  );
}
```

In this code snippet, we're using a feature flag, "enable_integration", to determine whether to enable integration based on a given user session. The `FeatureFlagClient.getFlags()` function retrieves the feature flag's value, which subsequently drives the decision-making in the `enable_integration` function.

### Benefits

By isolating the decision rule (feature flag) from the decision point (`enable_integration` function), we promote code clarity and maintainability. This approach allows us to modify the feature flag or the decision point independently, leading to more straightforward and less error-prone code changes.

Further, it also aids in managing feature flags that are meant to persist over time, ensuring that they don't inadvertently permeate and clutter the codebase.

This practice brings us one step closer to adhering to the principles of clean code and solid design, which ultimately results in software that's easier to understand, debug, and evolve.
